## Lessons Learned:
- Conduct Forensic Analysis for .apmx64 file.
- Using API Monitor tool to analysis the file and intercept the function call. 

## SCENARIO:

<p align="justify">Forela Corporation heavily depends on the utilisation of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), and currently, threat actors are leveraging this feature, taking advantage of its elusive nature that makes it difficult for defenders to detect. In response, the red team at Forela has executed a range of commands using WSL2 and shared API logs for analysis.</p>

## STEPS:
1. In this task, we're given a `.apmx64` file which we can analyze using API Monitor tool.
