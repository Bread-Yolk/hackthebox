## SCENARIO:
A junior member of our security team has been performing research and testing on what we believe to be an old and insecure operating system. 
We believe it may have been compromised & have managed to retrieve a memory dump of the asset. 
We want to confirm what actions were carried out by the attacker and if any other assets in our environment might be affected. 
Please answer the questions below.

## STEPS:
1. In this challenge we're tasked to do a memory forensic from a memory dump to identify whether the operating system is compromised.
