## Lessons Learned:
1. sada

## SCENARIO:

<p align="justify">Following a recent report of a data breach at their company, the client submitted a potentially malicious executable file. The file originated from a link within a phishing email received by a victim user. Your objective is to analyze the binary to determine its functionality and possible consequences it may have on their network. By analyzing the functionality and potential consequences of this binary, you can gain valuable insights into the scope of the data breach and identify if it facilitated data exfiltration. Understanding the binary's capabilities will enable you to provide the client with a comprehensive report detailing the attack methodology, potential data at risk, and recommended mitigation steps.</p>

## STEPS:
1. In this investigation case, we're tasked to reverse engineer a malicious executable file which originated from a link within an email identified as phising.
2. Once we gained valuable insights into the scope of the data breach, we're asked to provide the client with a comprehensive report detailing the attack methodology, potential data at risk, and a recommended mitigation steps (which we won't do in this writeup).
