## Lessons Learned:
1. SAD

## SCENARIO:

Simon, a developer working at Forela, notified the CERT team about a note that appeared on his desktop. 
The note claimed that his system had been compromised and that sensitive data from Simon's workstation had been collected. 
The perpetrators performed data extortion on his workstation and are now threatening to release the data on the dark web 
unless their demands are met. Simon's workstation contained multiple sensitive files, including planned software projects, 
internal development plans, and application codebases. The threat intelligence team believes that the threat actor made some mistakes, 
but they have not found any way to contact the threat actors. The company's stakeholders are insisting that this incident be resolved 
and all sensitive data be recovered. They demand that under no circumstances should the data be leaked. As our junior security analyst, 
you have been assigned a specific type of DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response) investigation in this case. 
The CERT lead, after triaging the workstation, has provided you with only the Notepad++ artifacts, suspecting that the attacker 
created the extortion note and conducted other activities with hands-on keyboard access. Your duty is to determine how the 
attack occurred and find a way to contact the threat actors, as they accidentally locked out their own contact information.
