## Lessons Learned:
- sadasd

## SCENARIO:
<p align="justify">
  The SOC team has recently been alerted to the potential existence of an insider threat. The suspect employee's workstation has been secured and examined. During the memory analysis, the Senior DFIR Analyst succeeded in extracting several intriguing URLs from the memory. These are now provided to you for further analysis to uncover any evidence, such as indications of data exfiltration or contact with malicious entities. Should you discover any information regarding the attacking group or individuals involved, you will collaborate closely with the threat intelligence team. Additionally, you will assist the Forensics team in creating a timeline. Warning : This Sherlock will require an element of OSINT and some answers can be found outside of the provided artifacts to complete fully.
</p>

## STEPS:
1. In this challenge we're tasked to do further analysis of artifacts which extracted by the IR team. Based from the artifacts, we're told to do information gathering regarding all individuals involved in this incident and collaborate with the Threat Intelligence team.
