## Lessons Learned:
- sdasd

## SCENARIO:
In this Sherlock, you will familiarize yourself with Sysmon logs and various useful EventIDs for identifying and analyzing malicious activities on a Windows system. 
Palo Alto's Unit42 recently conducted research on an UltraVNC campaign, wherein attackers utilized a backdoored version of UltraVNC to maintain access to systems. 
This lab is inspired by that campaign and guides participants through the initial access stage of the campaign.


## STEPS:
1. In this challenge, we're tasked to analyze malicious act on a Windows system by reviewing a Windows Event Log file which contains sysmon logs.

#### NOTES:

```
Sysmon (System Monitor) logs are a type of log generated by the Sysinternals Sysmon utility, which is a Windows system service and
device driver thatprovides advanced system monitoring and logging capabilities. Sysmon logs capture detailed information about
various activities happening on a Windows system, including process creation, network connections, file creation, registry modifications,
and more.
```

2. To analyze this type of log file we can use **Event Viewer**.
