## SCENARIO:

<p align="justify">Forela is in need of your assistance. They were informed by an employee that their Discord account had been used to send a message with a link to a file they suspect is malware. The message read: "Hi! I've been working on a new game I think you may be interested in it. It combines a number of games we like to play together, check it out!". The Forela user has tried to secure their Discord account, but somehow the messages keep being sent and they need your help to understand this malware and regain control of their account!
