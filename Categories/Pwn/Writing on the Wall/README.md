## Lessons Learned:
1. Stack-Based Exploitation.
2. Out-of-Bound (OOB) Write.
3. read() vuln.
4. Local variable overwrite.

## DESCRIPTION:
<p align="justify">As you approach a password-protected door, a sense of uncertainty envelops youâ€”no clues, no hints. Yet, just as confusion takes hold, your gaze locks onto cryptic markings adorning the nearby wall. Could this be the elusive password, waiting to unveil the door's secrets?</p>

## STEPS:
1. In this challenge, we're given a 64 bit binary, dynamically linked, and not stripped.

2. Upon reviewing the decompiled code in ghidra, we can clearly spot the vuln at the read() usage. It introduced a OOB vuln.

3. It's quite straightforward then.
4. Reviewing the stack, seems the position of **password** is adjacent below **buffer**. Hence, hitting RBP shall overwrite **password**.
5. Remember about read() vuln, it reads data until it meet a NULL byte.
6. So then, utilizing the OOB could overwrite the **password** value entirely.
