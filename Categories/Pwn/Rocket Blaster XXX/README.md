# Rocket Blaster XXX
> Write-up author: jon-brandy

## Lessons Learned:
1. ROP gadgets.
2. Manipulate return address.
3. Popping 3 gadgets.

## DESCRIPTION:

<p align="justify">Prepare for the ultimate showdown! Load your weapons, gear up for battle, and dive into the epic frayâ€”let the fight commence!</p>

## STEPS:
1. In this challenge we're given a 64 bit binary, dynamically linked, not stripped.

2. Upon reviewing the decompiled code on ghidra, we can see the main() function only accepts 1 input then terminate the process.

3. Reviewing other functions, we noticed a function named `fill_ammo` which opens the flag file then print it's content.

4. Seems the objective here is to return to `fill_ammo`. Noticed the `fill_ammo` function accepts 3 params, those 3 also used for a checker.
5. However since there is no canary and PIE is disabled, hence it's very easy for us to pwn the binary.

6. Great! Next, let's search for useful gadgets.
7. Popping 3 values to param, means we need RDI (as the 1st arg), RSI (as the 2nd arg), and RDX (as the 3rd arg).

8. Seems the gadgets are provided to us. We can utilize it then.
