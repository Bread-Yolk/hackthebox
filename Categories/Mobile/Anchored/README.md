## DESCRIPTION:
A client asked me to check if I can intercept the https request and get the value of the secret parameter that is passed along with the user's email. 
The application is intended to run in a non-rooted device. 
Can you help me find a way to intercept this value in plain text.
## HINT:
- NONE
## STEPS:
1. In this challenge we're given an apk file, noticed the README file says 2 notes to run this apk.

```
1. API leve 29 or earlier.
2. Non-rooted device.
```
