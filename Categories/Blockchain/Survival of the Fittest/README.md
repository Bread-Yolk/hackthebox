# Survival of the Fittest
## DESCRIPTION:
Alex had always dreamed of becoming a warrior, but she wasn't particularly skilled. When the opportunity arose to join a group of seasoned warriors on a quest to a mysterious island filled with real-life monsters, she hesitated. But the thought of facing down fearsome beasts and emerging victorious was too tempting to resist, and she reluctantly agreed to join the group. As they made their way through the dense, overgrown forests of the island, Alex kept her senses sharp, always alert for the slightest sign of danger. But as she crept through the underbrush, sword drawn and ready, she was startled by a sudden movement ahead of her. She froze, heart pounding in her chest as she realized that she was face to face with her first monster.
